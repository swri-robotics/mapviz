/**
 * This is a very simple event filter that listens for mouseReleased events;
 * when it sees one, it emits a signal with the given point.
 *
 * Click events are filtered by how long the mouse was held down and how far the
 * cursor moved in order to prevent the user holding and dragging the map
 * from firing a click event.  By default, "clicks" that take longer than 500ms
 * or move longer than 2 pixels are ignored.
