* Contributors: Marc Alban

0.2.2 (2016-12-07)
------------------
* Migrated OpenCV to 3.1 (default in Kinetic)
* General code cleanup of mapviz_plugins
  This doesn't change any functionality; it's just cleaning up code.  Notably, this will:
  - Fix all warnings (notably lots of ones about type casting)
  - Move all .ui files to their own directory
  - Remove unused variables
  - Remove commented-out code
  - Make spacing and indentation consistent
  - Make brace style consistent
* Contributors: Brian Holt, Marc Alban, P. J. Reed

0.2.1 (2016-10-23)
------------------
* Add a GUI for controlling the Image Transport (`#432 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/432>`_)
  This will add a sub-menu under the "View" menu that will:
  - List all available image transports
  - Indicate which one is currently the default
  - Allow the user to choose which one will be used for new ImageTransport subscriptions
  - Save and restore this setting to Mapviz's config file
  - Cause any `image` plugins using the default transport to resubscribe
  In addition, the image plugin now has a menu that can be used to change the
  transport for that specific plugin so that it is different from the default.
  Fixes `#430 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/430>`_
  Conflicts:
  mapviz/package.xml
* Fix icon colors for point drawing plugins (`#433 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/433>`_)
  This was probably broken back when all of these were refactored to have a
  single base class.  It looks like the member variable that holds the color
  used to draw the icon was never actually being updated.
  Fixes `#426 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/426>`_
* Add option to not scale arrows with zoom level
  This adds a checkbox to all of the plugins that can draw a series of
  coordinates as arrows; i. e., the NavSatFix, Odometry, and TF Frame
  plugins.  This checkbox will control whether the arrows are drawn at a fixed
  size regardless of zoom level or whether they are scaled with the zoom level.
  Resolves `#414 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/414>`_
* Fix signed comparison warnings in mapviz_plugins
* Adding a way for plugin config widgets to resize
  - Adding an event plugins can emit to indicate their geometry has changed
  - Modifying the PCL2 plugin to use it as an example
  Fixes `#393 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/393>`_
* Adding default values for uninitialized variables
  Resolves `#372 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/372>`_
* Creates and implements an abstract class for drawing point paths
  Updates gps,navsat,odometry,path, and tf_frame plugins to use the
  abstract point drawing class. Also adds the draw laps functionality
  which will change the color of the path as it passes a base point for
  ease of visibility, currently implemented on gps and odometry plugins.
  Conflicts:
  mapviz_plugins/CMakeLists.txt
  mapviz_plugins/include/mapviz_plugins/gps_plugin.h
  mapviz_plugins/src/gps_config.ui
  mapviz_plugins/src/gps_plugin.cpp
* Ensuring that Mapviz won't subscribe to empty topic names (`#379 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/379>`_)
  Clean up and made more consistent the code for handling subscriptions for all topics.
  The behavior is now:
  - All input is trimmed before processing
  - If a topic name is empty, the old subscriber will be shut down and will not subscribe to the empty topic
  Resolves `#327 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/327>`_
* Fixing some typos in documentation.
* Implementing support for the ARROW marker type
  Resolves `#365 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/365>`_
* Contributors: Ed Venator, Marc Alban, P. J. Reed

0.2.0 (2016-06-23)
------------------
* Update Qt to version 5
* Fixing a crash in the PointCloud2 plugin
  Also sneaking in a few more changes:
  - Caching transformed clouds to improve performance
  - Properly saving the value of the "Color Transformer" combo box
* Returning "false" if no other code handles the mouse event
  Fixes `#360 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/360>`_
* Contributors: Ed Venator, P. J. Reed

0.1.3 (2016-05-20)
------------------
* Implement mapviz plug-in for calling the marti_nav_msgs::PlanRoute service.
* Migrate route plugin to use swri_route_util
  This change migrates the mapviz route plugin to use swri_route_util to
  get consistent behavior with route transforms and route position
  interpolation.  As part of this change, the route is now transformed
  with each draw so that it will correctly move around if the transform
  between the fixed frame and the route frame is not constant.
* Add support for mono8 textured markers.
* Implement service for adding and modifying mapviz displays.
* Adding attitude indicator plugin.
* Changing some "unsigned long"s to "size_t"s.
* Storing source frames individually for plugins w/ buffers
* Fix for `#265 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/265>`_; message source frames don't update
  Several plugins were storing the source frames of messages received when
  they first received a message but never updating them, so subsequent
  messages in different frames would be rendered incorrectly.
* Fix for `#339 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/339>`_; explicitly depending on OpenCV 2
* Fix route position search
  The route position search would ignore a matching point unless it is
  already transformed, which means that only points that have already been
  searched and missed would be transformed.
  The new logic looks first for the match, then transforms as necessary.
  Unmatched points are ignored.
* Guard against repeated transforms
  A point should only be transformed once, because the mapviz transforms
  are set outside the plugins; `TransformPoint` will now only transform
  un-transformed points.
* Remove unused variable
  prev_position\_ is set, but never actually used.
* Adds route plugin with routeposition marker attachment.
* Also updating the disparity plugin
* Fixing `#317 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/317>`_
  First, the model view matrix needs to be saved and restored around
  QPainter operations because Qt clears several GL variables.  Also, the
  image plugin needed to explicitly call glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
  it does a few operations on the projection matrix and was just assuming
  that was the current matrix mode.  Also, I added a function that plugins
  need to override if they want to do QPainter operations; this will
  eliminate unnecessary overhead for plugins that do not.
* Declaring types for Qt signal/slot use properly
* Fixing some typos
* Doing GL drawing on the main thread for `#313 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/mapviz/issues/313>`_
* GPS plugin snuck back into CMakeLists.txt
* A plugin for displaying std_msgs/Strings
* Marker plugin will use a QPainter to draw text
  I modified the Marker plugin so that it will use a QPainter to draw
  text labels rather than OpenGL commands.  This doesn't really add any
  functional benefit; it's meant to serve as an example of how to use
  the QPainter.
* Fixing warnings and cleaning up formatting
* updated mapviz_plugins.xml
* add pointcloud2 plugin
* Update map canvas at a fixed rate.
  This update adds a timer to the map canvas to repaint at a fixed rate.
  The default rate is 50 Hz, but there is a method to change it (not
  exposed to the UI at the moment).  50Hz was chosen because it is fast
  enough to give smooth animations and we almost always are running
  mapviz with at least one plugin triggering updates from a 50Hz topic.
* Making the Image plugin use image_transport.
  The image_transport package provides support for transparently
  subscribing and publishing to topics using low-bandwidth compressed
  formats; if the publisher supports it, this will cause the Image
  plugin to consume far less bandwidth than before.
* Handle cases where marker topic changes message types.
  This commit makes a better effort to properly support cases where a
  marker topic changes between Marker and MarkerArray during runtime.
* Use ROS' shapeshifter to handle marker/marker arrays.
* This commit adds a class called SelectFrameDialog that plugins can use
  to present the user with a dialog to choose a TF frame. The dialog
  sorts the frames by name and provides an edit box that the user can
  use to filter the frames to a specific substring.
* Indigo compatibility.
  Fixing swri_transform_util and swri_yaml_util API changes from
  Hydro to Indigo.
* Also filtering out clicks that are held for too long.
* Adding a check to prevent the click event from firing if the user is dragging the mouse.
* Fixing an issue that could cause the click publisher plugin's publisher to not be initialized after it's first added.
* Removing some code I had added for debugging.
* Adding a plugin that, when a user clicks on a point, will publish that point's coordinates to a topic.
* Adding color button widget and updating plugins.
  This commit adds a subclass of QPushButton called ColorButton that
  implements a widget for displaying and selecting colors.  We've been
  doing this manually everywhere with duplicated code.  This is a simple
  abstraction but allows us to elminate a lot of duplication, especially
  in plugins that have multiple color selections.
* Adds SelectTopicDialog to mapviz.
  This commit adds the SelectTopicDialog that can be used in plugins to
  provide the user with a dialog to select topics.  Typically we have
  done this with a lot of duplicated code across all the plugins.  This
  commit also updates the plugins in mapviz_plugins to use the new
  dialog.
  The new dialog provides several benefits:
  - Reduced code duplication
  - Simplifies writing new plugins
  - Common behavior between all plugins
  - Topics sorted by name
  - User can filter topics by substring
  - Continuously checks the master for new topics while the dialog is open.
